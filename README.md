## So Basically...

This projects goal was to create a visually-appealing and responsive web page using advanced CSS techniques. 
The HTML structure organizes the content into easy-to-understand and logical sections, and the CSS I wrote applies the styling needed to achieve the cohesive design I was shooting for. I use flexbox for layout, custom styling for individual elements, and include various interactive components (such as the banner button and the overlapping tutorial thumbnails) to demonstrat a higher level of CSS proficiency.

## HTML File(s) (`index.html`, `pricing.html`, `courses.html`)

My HTML file is the bones to a well-structured web page that showcases my advanced CSS implementation. 
Here's a short breakdown of the main sections;

1. **Head**: This section includes the page title and a link to the external CSS file `styles.css`.
2. **Body**:
   - **Header**: This section contains the website's logo and a navigation menu with links to different sections.
   - **Banner**: This section includes a hero banner with a call-to-action button.
   - **Quote Section**: This section displays a testimonial with an image and a quote.
   - **Tutorial Section**: This section presents a series of tutorials, each with a thumbnail, title, description, author information, and a rating.
   - **Membership Section**: This section showcases the benefits of a free membership program.
   - **FAQ Section**: This section includes a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section.
   - **Footer**: This section contains the website's logo, social media links, and a copyright notice.

   ### - and (mostly) the same goes for the pricing and courses pages!

## CSS File (`styles.css`)

My CSS file defines the styles for the aforementioend web page. 
Here's a short summary of the main elements:

1. **General Styles**: These styles apply to the overall wrapper, body, and text formatting.
2. **Centering Styles**: These styles center the content both horizontally and vertically using flexbox.
3. **Header and First Section**: These styles define the appearance of the header, logo, navigation menu, and the first section's content.

6. **Tutorials Section**: These styles control the layout and styling of the tutorial section, including the thumbnail, title, description, author information, and rating.
7. **Membership Section**: These styles define the appearance of the membership section.
